                                When required to use multiple apps to access and keep track of healthcare information, it becomes complicated for the user 
                                to keep track of schedules, costs of visits, insurance claims, and communications with providers.
                                </p>
        
                                <h3>A Solution for Organization</h3>
           
                               <p class="long-text">A possible solution to this problem will be to create an app that will allow the user to integrate their insurance 
                                information, medical provider, dental, and vision care. This will give the user access to manage each of their healthcare accounts and information in one platform.

                                <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                                The target audience for this product is any user who is subscribed to an insurance plan that has separate providers for vision and dental. The user will require all of their medical information on one platform.
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Competition:</h3>
                                Obvious competitors are other private medical providers such as Kaiser Permanente, MyHealth, MyChart, and Carbon Health. A competitor would be any healthcare provider than offers medical, dental, and vision in one platform.
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Risk/Opportunity:</h3>
                                A risk to creating this app would be integrating the applications and information from a variety of medical providers. There are not many apps that allow syncing, but one example would be TrueBill, a banking app, that syncs the information so the user can access it in one application. This provides an opportunity to create a more useful medical platform to eliminate using multiple apps for medical, vision, dental, and insurance.

                                    Problem:
                                    When asked to navigate to their Account page to move forward with linking an account, the users were not able to find the feature on the dashboard of where to find their Account settings. All 5 participants were challenged with this issue.
                                    To resolve this issue, I included text on the dashboard and include where to locate Accounts in the onboarding process.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Issue 2</b><br>
                                    Problem:
                                    When asked to link a healthcare account, the users would navigate to their Coverage page from their dashboard. Out of the 5 participants, 4 made this initial error.
                                    I added an opetion to the Coverage page to “Link an Account” as well as in the Account settings. Depending on the user, the option to link a healthcare account would fall under the coverage category or as an account settings feature.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Issue 3</b><br>
                                    When asked to send a message to a provider, the users were confused as to where to enter their message. Out of the five participants, two of the users clicked the send button before tapping the empty text field to enter a message.
                                    To resolve this issue, I added a placeholder text to help users identify the field in which to enter message text.

                                behaviors while navigating through the prototype. I was able to update my prototype to how the 
                                users will intuitively use it best. I made it possible for the users to access the same features in 
                                the same amount of steps based on where they would naturally look for what they need. I would like to 
                                perform a usability test with a new set of participants to see if the same errors are made, as well as 
                                with the same participants to get their feedback on the improvements.</p><br>
